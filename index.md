## October 9th - 16th - Bring in Purchases/Raspberry Pi Setup 
During this time period, I gathered all of the purchases I needed for the project. I got my Raspberry Pi Kit first and then Adafruit 9-DOF Accel/Mag/Gyro+Temp Breakout Board - LSM9DS0 a few days later. I got my last purchase which was the Adafruit Ultimate GPS FeatherWing a week later. Also after I got my Raspberry Pi, I decided to set it up during the fall study days. I installed the rasbian OS from the class site and followed the instructions on the StudentSenseHat github page.
