## October 30th - PCB Design 
to be updated 

## October 23rd - Breadboard Milestone
### Soldering 
For the Breadboarding milestone, both the adafruit 9-DOF Accel/Mag/Gyro+Temp Breakout Board - LSM9DS0 and the Adafruit Ultimate GPS FeatherWing I had to solder it with the pins. Soldering both the sensors was pretty easy due to the fact that I had prior knowledge of soldering from the school project I did when I was in high school. 

### Breadboarding 
Once I finished soldering my sensors to the pins I plugged them both into the breadboard I have in my Humber parts kit. I looked at the datasheet/Pinout layout for both my sensors, which will be linked below. I also looked the Pinout layouts for the Raspberry Pi 3 and made my following connections for the circuit. Once I finished breadboarding I went on fritzing and made the same connections on the application.

## October 9th - 16th - Bring in Purchases/Raspberry Pi Setup 
During this time period, I gathered all of the purchases I needed for the project. I got my Raspberry Pi Kit first and then Adafruit 9-DOF Accel/Mag/Gyro+Temp Breakout Board - LSM9DS0 a few days later. I got my last purchase which was the Adafruit Ultimate GPS FeatherWing a week later. Also after I got my Raspberry Pi, I decided to set it up during the fall study days. I installed the rasbian OS from the class site and followed the instructions on the StudentSenseHat github page.

## October 2nd - Proof of Purchase
